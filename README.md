# 15-Front-End-Web-Development-ND-Project-2-Portfolio
'portfolio' page for a developer, which responds dynamically to screen width changes, adapting images &amp; text to fit

### README
1. This project comprises:
  - `index.html`
  - `design-mock-up-portfolio-stylesheet.css`
  - `README.md`
  - `html_css_sample_dolphin_small.jpg`
  - `html_css_sample_dolphin_medium.jpg`
  - `python_quiz_small.jpg`
  - `python_quiz_medium.jpg`
  - `webpage_films_small.png`
  - `webpage_films_medium.png`
  - `image_android_app_tiny.jpg`
  - `image_android_app_small.jpg`
  - `image_android_app_tiny.jpg`
  - `udacity-logo-img.jpg`

  2. The different size image files use `<picture>`tags, to appear/be replaced by more appropriate size image  versions when screen sizes change. The very large 'android' image has 3 different size versions.

  3. The application uses `Flexbox` to dynamically create three horizontal rectangular area behaviors when width makes it possible, the:
  -  first for the top rows with logo and title texts arranged vertically
  -  second the large 'android' image with two text items below it arranged vertically
  -  third is below that with the three smaller images arranged horizontally.

  4. The web page has been tested for single-column display suitable for small mobile phones, for wider displays in iPads/tablets and full-screen PC displays. Modern browser versions Chrome, Firefox, Opera and MS Edge were used to test.
