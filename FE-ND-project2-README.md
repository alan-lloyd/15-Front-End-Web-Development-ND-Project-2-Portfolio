  2. The different size image files use `<picture>`tags, to appear/be replaced by more appropriate size image  versions when screen sizes change. The very large 'android' image has 3 different size versions.

  3. The application also uses `Flexbox` to dynamically create two horizontal rows when width makes it possible, the first for the left-hand `svg` color boxes with the large 'android' image to its right, and below that the three smaller images arranged in a horizontal line.

  4. The web page has been tested for single-column display suitable for small mobile phones, for wider displays in iPads/tablets and full-screen PC displays. Modern browser versions Chrome, Firefox, Opera and MS Edge were used to test.
